                    <p>I've seen lots of posts from people, much farther along in life than me, detail a set of things that they believe in. I've always strayed away from publishing one of my own, primarily because I find myself possibly being too young to have beliefs that I can concretely say I will always follow.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Maybe all of these beliefs will change, maybe a few, maybe none; but from the 17 years I've been on this earth: here are some things I believe in.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>1. Be, unapologetically, kind.</p>
                    <p>2. Working a lot â‰  working smart. However, working smart can (and often does) require you to work a lot.</p>
                    <p>3. Being a charismatic person is an amazing & important aspiration to have.</p>
                    <p>4. Never be in the absence of learning.</p>
                    <p>5. Reading of all kinds, but specifically books, is something time has to be made for.</p>
                    <p>6. Surround yourself with people you aspire to be like.</p>
                    <p>7. Never let go of humility and humbleness. (By extension, always be willing to seek knowledge from people around you.)</p>
